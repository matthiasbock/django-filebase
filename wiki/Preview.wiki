#summary Preview

= Content Preview =

I want the file content to be previewable without requesting the whole file.
This basically means:
The standard file browser must be able to extract a valid thumbnail
from the file. Still it shall show correct picture dimensions
(e.g. in the status bar) and correct MIME info.
Also _file_ shall return a correct MIME.
The EXIF tag would also be nice.
